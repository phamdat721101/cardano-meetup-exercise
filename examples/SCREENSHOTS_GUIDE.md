# Hydra Layer 2 Coding Exercise Template

## Exercise Title

_Example: Running Hydra Nodes Locally and Executing Fast Transactions_

---

## Overview

Briefly describe the objective of this exercise.  
_Example: Get familiar with the Hydra Layer 2 protocol by setting up Hydra nodes, opening a Head, and executing fast transactions collaboratively._

---

## Prerequisites

- List what participants should have installed (e.g. Docker, Cardano CLI, Hydra binaries).
- Mention any accounts or access required (test wallets, tokens, etc.)

---

## Learning Objectives

- [ ] Understand Hydra Layer 2 concepts on Cardano
- [ ] Set up and run Hydra nodes
- [ ] Open, commit, transact, and close a Hydra Head
- [ ] Observe quick, low-fee transaction processing

---

## Step-by-Step Instructions

### 1. Setup Environment

Describe build/run steps.  
_E.g.: Clone repository, install dependencies, prepare wallets, etc._

### 2. Initialize Hydra Nodes

Commands and explanation, e.g.:
```bash
hydra-node --testnet-magic 42 ...
```
Describe expected output and troubleshooting tips.

### 3. Open a Hydra Head

_Example commands/steps_  
What participants should see as confirmation.

### 4. Commit Funds and Transact

Show example transactions, CLI commands, output, and interpretation.

### 5. Close Hydra Head

Demonstrate proper shutdown and closing protocols.

### 6. Review/Discussion

Questions to ask, things to look out for, or debug scenarios.

---

## Collaborative Activity

Describe a group simulation, e.g.:
- Break into teams, simulate multi-party commits & transactions.
- Discuss speed, security, and scalability features.

---

## Challenge Tasks (Optional)

Suggest extension ideas for advanced users, e.g.:
- Build a custom transaction scenario
- Automate transactions with a script
